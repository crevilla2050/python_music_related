# This script organizes music files by moving them into artist/album directories,
# normalizing names, applying aliases, and logging duplicates.
# It uses the Mutagen library to read audio tags and supports various audio formats.
# It also computes SHA-256 hashes to detect duplicates and logs them in a JSON file.
# The script can be run from the command line with a source directory and an alias JSON file.
# If a target directory is not specified, it uses the source directory for organization.
# The aliases JSON file should contain "artist_aliases" and "album_aliases" keys
# with normalized names as keys and actual names as values.
# The script creates directories for artists and albums, normalizes filenames,
# and handles potential naming conflicts by appending "_dup" to duplicate filenames.
# It logs all operations, including errors, to a log file and outputs the results to the console.
# If duplicates are found, they are logged in a separate JSON file for further review.
# The script is designed to be robust against various file system issues and provides clear feedback on its operations.
# It can be easily extended to support additional audio formats or more complex organization schemes if needed.
# The script is intended for personal music libraries but can be adapted for larger collections or different organizational schemes.
# It is a useful tool for anyone looking to clean up and organize their music collection efficiently.
# The script can be run in a Python environment with the Mutagen library installed.
# It is recommended to run the script in a controlled environment first to ensure it behaves as expected.
# It is also advisable to back up your music collection before running the script to prevent accidental data loss.
# The script is designed to be run from the command line, making it easy to integrate
# into existing workflows or automation scripts.
# It can be scheduled to run periodically to keep the music library organized as new files are added.
# The script is open source and can be modified to suit individual needs or preferences.
# It is released under the MIT License, allowing for free use and modification.
# The script is intended to be user-friendly, with clear error messages and logging to help diagnose
# any issues that may arise during execution.
# It is designed to handle a wide range of audio file formats and naming conventions,
# making it versatile for different music collections.
# The script can be easily integrated into larger music management systems or used as a standalone tool.
# It is a practical solution for organizing music files based on metadata and file structure.
